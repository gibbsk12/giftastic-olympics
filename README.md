# giftastic-olympics
This is the sixth homework assignment for the University of Richmond Coding Bootcamp.

In this assignment, we were required to use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populated with gifs related to a theme of our chosing. To finish the task, we had to call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of our site. 

# Instructions 
To use the Olympic GIF Finder, click on one of the buttons. Ten GIFs related to that topic will populate. To play each GIF, click on the picture. To stop playing the GIF, click on the picture once more. To add your own Olympic-related topic, use the form and "Add A Topic" button.
